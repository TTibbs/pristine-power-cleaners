# Jet/Pressure Washing Business Landing Page
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the repository for my jet/pressure washing business landing page project. I'm excited to share with you what I've been working on.

## What is This Project About?
This project is a non-tutorial learning exercise that I completed to demonstrate my grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I wanted to create a landing page for a jet/pressure washing business.

## Technologies Used
In this project, I've used a combination of technologies to make everything come together:

### HTML: 
I've crafted the structure of the webpage using HTML. This provides the foundation for the content and layout.
### CSS: 
To make the webpage look visually appealing, I've used CSS to style elements and ensure everything looks just right.
### JavaScript: 
While I'm still working on this part, JavaScript will add interactivity and dynamic features to the website, making it more engaging for visitors.

### Open the HTML: 
Start by opening the HTML file. This is where the structure of the webpage is defined. You'll see how the content is organized.

### Check Out the CSS: 
Dive into the CSS file to see how I've styled various elements. You'll find comments that explain what each part does.

### Stay Tuned for JavaScript: 
While the JavaScript part is still a work in progress, I'm excited to implement dynamic features and interactions soon.
